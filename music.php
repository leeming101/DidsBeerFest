			<img src="Images/66Cover.jpg" width="175px">
			<p>Route 66 have been doing the live circuit now for 25 years and in that time they have done 1000 plus shows, from big festivals to the smallest pubs they`ve done it. They like to play their rnb with a no nonsense attitude. Its music filled with riffing guitars and honking harmonica which lends a sound towards bands like the stones and dr feelgood but also with a nod and a wink to the classic blues like muddy waters and howlin wolf. This isnt music to cry into your beer to!</p>
